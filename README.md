## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

The inspiration is from a YouTube video "Playing with Perlin Noise in p5.js - generative art with lots of options, plus wave convections", at:

The effect of ripples attracts me, which is triggered by dragging the mouse on the screen, and several ripples are stimulated to generate:

With time going on, the tiny random scale ripples grow larger, when they hit the edges of canvas, they get a force and go back as growing larger. Finally, the image gets engergetic with massive ripples:
